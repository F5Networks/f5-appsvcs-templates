  load_balancing_mode:
    title: Load Balancing Method
    description: A *load balancing method* is an algorithm that the BIG-IP system uses
      to select a pool member for processing a request. F5 recommends the Least Connections
      load balancing method, where new connections are routed to the node that has the
      least number of current connections. This is ideal for environments in which pool
      members have similar performance and capacity capabilities.
    type: string
  slow_ramp_time:
    title: Slow Ramp Time
    description: Slowly increases the number of connection requests that are load balanced
      to a new pool member. Recommended value is 300 seconds.
