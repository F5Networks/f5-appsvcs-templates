### TODO
- [ ] [Changelog entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/changelog.html) 
- [ ] Update version hash in nodejs/fastWorker.js 
- [ ] Pass all tests locally: `npm run testall`
- [ ] If breaking changes are suspected, run integration tests(`npm run testinteg`) - which require environment variables pointing to a dev environment that has an RPM matching your local changes.
