Integrating FAST into Applications
==================================

The core templating logic of FAST can be found in the `f5-fast-core library <https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-fast-core>`_.
This is a JavaScript library that can be used to integrate FAST templating into your own applications.
It is also available `on NPM <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@f5devcentral/f5-fast-core>`_ as ``@f5devcentral/f5-fast-core``.

For information on how to use this library in your applications, please take a look at the library's `README file <https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-fast-core/blob/develop/README.md>`_.
