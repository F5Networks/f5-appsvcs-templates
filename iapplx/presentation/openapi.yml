    # F5 Application Services Templates (*FAST*)

    This is the documentation for the FAST templating extension. This document
    catalogs the API endpoints exposed by the extension.

    ## Application Management

    These are endpoints related to managing the lifecycle of your applications.
    These endpoints help you create, edit, and query the applications managed by
    FAST.

    ## Task Tracking

    When an application is created in may not happen instantly. A task is run to
    deploy the AS3 declaration. These endpoints are for retrieving information
    about currently running and previously run tasks. These endpoints will report
    the success or failure of a particular deployment action, such as creating
    or editing an application.

    ## Package Management

    This is the API for loading and unloading new template sets into the system.

    ## Template Management

    This is the API for Querying templates that are loaded into the system.

    ## FAST Extension

    These endpoints are related to management of the FAST Extension itself,
    for getting debug information or software version information.

      summary: Create an application from a template
      description: |
        This is the main method to deploy a templated application. The parameters posted will be used
        to render a template, and that template will get posted to AS3.

        The call to AS3 may be async, so this endpoint must also be async. A task will be returned upon
        successful parameter submission that can track the progress of the deployment.
